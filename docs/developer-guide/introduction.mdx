Thanks for your interest in contributing to QuizApp!

QuizApp is a monorepo that powers our learning experience across frontend, backend, and shared contracts. This guide highlights how to get started and where you can have the most impact.

<Warning>
Maintainers review every proposal to ensure it aligns with the roadmap, user outcomes, and technical guardrails before merging.

## Contributing to QuizApp

### Start with the Product Context
Understanding the learner journey keeps contributions aligned with QuizApp's mission. Read through the foundational docs before picking up work.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Use Cases" icon="book" href="/docs/use-cases">
    Learn how quiz attempts, learning mode, and history views should behave end-to-end.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Architecture" icon="diagram-project" href="/docs/architecture">
    Review the monorepo layout, data flow between packages, and key decisions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wireframes" icon="pen-ruler" href="/docs/wireframes">
    Align UI contributions with the official wireframes and UX conventions.
  </Card>
</Columns>

Every package also ships an `AGENTS.md` file and purpose-built Skills under `skills/`. When you touch a feature, load the relevant skill (e.g., `quizapp-ui` for frontend, `quizapp-api` for backend) so that humans and AI contributors follow the same playbook.

### Find Work in the Backlog
Open issues and discussions live in GitHub. Filter by labels such as `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or package-specific tags to discover tasks that match your experience level.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Good First Issue" icon="github" href="https://github.com/quizapphq/quiz-experience/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">
    Self-contained changes ideal for first-time contributors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Help Wanted" icon="github" href="https://github.com/quizapphq/quiz-experience/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">
    Larger efforts that benefit from extra reviewers or co-owners.

### Collaborate Early
- Leave a note on the issue you are taking to avoid duplicate work.
- Share WIP branches or draft PRs for larger refactors.
- Use GitHub Discussions or the team Slack channel to unblock domain questions (quiz attempt lifecycle, learning mode, etc.).

## Setting up your development environment

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have:

- Git 2.40+.
- Node.js 20 (LTS) or later.
- `pnpm` 9.x (QuizApp is a pnpm + Turborepo workspace).
- Optional: [Devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/docs/) if you prefer reproducible shells (see the `devbox` Skill for details).

### Forking the QuizApp Repository

Fork `quizapphq/quiz-experience` so you can push feature branches. GitHub's [forking guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) walks through the process.

### Cloning Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/quiz-experience
cd quiz-experience
git remote add upstream https://github.com/quizapphq/quiz-experience
```

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This bootstraps every workspace (frontend, backend, shared, infra tooling) and wires up Turborepo tasks.

### Running the Dev Servers

```bash
pnpm dev            # start everything via Turborepo
pnpm --filter frontend dev
pnpm --filter backend dev
```

Use package filters when you only need a specific surface area.

### Quality Gates

Run these locally before opening a pull request:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm format
```

- Biome enforces formatting and import order.
- Vitest + Supertest cover unit/integration tests.
- Playwright provides E2E (run via `pnpm --filter frontend test:e2e` when relevant).
- Turbo caches results, so reruns stay fast.

### AI-Driven Contributions

- Load the Skill that matches your task (e.g., `quizapp-ui`, `quizapp-domain`). Skills encode the conventions that AGENTS enforce.
- Each package exposes an `AGENTS.md`—read it before modifying files in that package.
- Never bypass lint/test commands; AI and human contributors are held to the same Definition of Done.

### Dependency Management

- Frontend/backed/shared dependencies live in their respective `package.json` files.
- Cross-package types or utilities belong in `shared/` and should be re-exported intentionally.
- Use `pnpm --filter ... add <package>` to scope new dependencies to a single workspace.

## Working Effectively in Each Package

- **Frontend (`quizapp-ui`, `nextjs-15`, `react-19`, `tailwind-4`)**: Use App Router server components by default; only add `use client` when you need browser APIs. Zustand stores live in `frontend/stores/` and persist quiz attempts to localStorage according to the domain rules in `quizapp-domain`.
- **Backend (`quizapp-api`, `express`)**: Keep routes thin. Validate payloads with shared Zod schemas and reuse the file-based quiz loaders from `backend/data/`.
- **Shared (`typescript`, `zod-4`)**: Schemas and types define contracts between packages. Update tests under `shared/` whenever schemas evolve.
- **Testing (`quizapp-testing`, `playwright`)**: Favor deterministic fixtures. When exercising attempt lifecycles, persist data the same way the frontend does so history pages remain accurate.

## Pull Requests

1. Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat(frontend): add learning mode banner`).
2. Include context, screenshots (for UI), and reproduction steps in the PR body.
3. Confirm lint, tests, and required build steps are green before requesting review.
4. Reference the issue you are closing with `Closes #123`.
5. Keep PRs scoped—split unrelated changes into separate branches when possible.

## Testing Changes from Another Branch

When you need to verify someone else's branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream <branch-name>
git checkout -b review/<branch-name> upstream/<branch-name>
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This keeps your fork in sync without polluting main.

## Contribution Appreciation
