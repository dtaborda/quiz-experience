# QuizApp — Use Cases & Routes (Functional Specification)

## Product Description

**QuizApp** is a small but realistic educational platform designed to help users **learn, practice, and reinforce AI software development concepts** such as agent design, prompt engineering, workflow automation, and model selection.

The product is intentionally scoped to feel **complete and production‑ready**, while remaining simple enough to be extended, improved, or scaled in future iterations.

QuizApp is not just a quiz engine — it is a **learning‑oriented product** that balances:

* assessment (scores, attempts, history)
* understanding (explanations, review, learning mode)
* good UX practices (clear navigation, persistence, predictable flows)

The platform supports:

* multiple quiz categories
* multiple attempts per quiz
* persistent user progress
* extensible architecture for future features

This document defines the **functional contract** for developers and autonomous agents implementing the application.

## Product Overview

AI Development Quiz is an educational quiz platform focused on AI software development concepts (agents, prompt engineering, workflows, model selection, etc.).

The product must feel:

* complete
* coherent
* extensible
* ready to scale

---

## Global UX & Domain Rules

* The authenticated user’s name is **always visible** in the top bar.
* A user can have:

  * **at most one active attempt per quiz**
  * **multiple completed attempts**
* History shows **only completed attempts**.
* Filters and sorting **do not change the visual row structure**.
* URLs represent **resources**, not internal steps.
* Question progress is **internal state**, not part of the URL.
* Persistence is handled via `localStorage` (acceptable for the interview).

---

---

* Highlighted access from Home
* **Wireframe:** `WF_DAILY_CHALLENGE`

---

### CU-OPT-03 — Learning mode

**As a user**, I want to learn the concept before answering the question, so I can understand the topic rather than only being evaluated.

#### Functional scope

Learning Mode is a variant of the normal quiz flow focused on guided learning.

* It is not a separate quiz
* It does not remove evaluation
* It does not reveal the correct answer in advance

The main difference is **the order in which information is shown**.

#### Behavior

* The mode is selected **before starting the quiz** (e.g. from Home or a pre‑start screen)
* The selected mode is stored in the attempt (`attempt.mode = "learn" | "normal"`)
* It applies to **all questions in the attempt**

#### Per‑question flow

1. A **conceptual explanation block** is shown first
2. The explanation provides context but **does not indicate the correct answer**
3. The user explicitly clicks **"View question"** or **"Continue"**
4. The question and options are displayed
5. The user answers and receives normal feedback

#### User sees

* A header indicating *Learning Mode*
* An educational text block before each question
* A clear CTA to proceed

#### Persistence

* The selected mode is saved in the attempt

* History, score, and overall behavior **do not change**

* **Wireframe:** `WF_LEARN_MODE`

---

### CU-OPT-04 — Randomized questions

**As a user**, I want the order of questions to change each time I take a quiz, to avoid memorizing answers by position.

#### Functional scope

* Each quiz has a **fixed set of questions** (e.g. 5)
* **No questions are added or removed**
* **Questions are not mixed across quizzes**

The feature only **randomizes the order of questions per attempt**.

#### Behavior

* The random order is generated **when the attempt is created**
* The order differs between attempts but is **stable within the same attempt**
* The order is persisted as part of the attempt

Example:

* Attempt 1: Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q4 → Q5
* Attempt 2: Q3 → Q1 → Q5 → Q2 → Q4

#### Persistence

* Order is stored in the attempt (e.g. `questionOrder[]`)
* Refreshing the browser does not change the order

#### UX

* The UI does not change
* Benefit: higher replayability and more honest evaluation

---

### CU-OPT-05 — Create your own quiz (extensible / future phase)

**As a user**, I want to create my own quiz to evaluate specific knowledge or share custom educational content.

> ⚠️ In the first version of the product, this feature is **NOT operational**. Its functional scope and UX are defined only as **preparation for future iterations**, with no active business logic.

---

#### Goal

Prepare the application to support user‑generated quizzes in the future without compromising the current architecture or introducing technical debt.

---

#### Functional scope — Current phase (placeholder)

In this version:

* Users cannot actually create quizzes
* No user‑generated content is persisted
* Existing quizzes cannot be modified

The feature is limited to an **informational screen** that:

* explains what the feature will be
* communicates that it is coming soon
* reinforces the vision of an extensible platform

---

#### Current behavior

* Users access **"Create your own quiz"** from:

  * Home
  * Global navigation

* The route is accessible but not editable

* **Route:** `/create-quiz`

---

#### User sees

* Clear title: "Create your own quiz"
* Status message: *"Coming soon"*
* Brief explanation of the feature’s goal:

  * create categories
  * add questions
  * define correct answers
* Passive CTA:

  * "Back to Home"
  * (optional) "Notify me when available"

---

#### UX / Design

* No active forms
* No validations
* No save buttons
* The screen does **not mislead** the user or create false expectations

---

#### Expected future scope (DO NOT IMPLEMENT now)

This section defines **intent**, not current tasks.

Future versions may include:

* Creating a quiz with:

  * title
  * description
  * category
* Adding questions:

  * text
  * multiple options
  * correct answer
  * explanation
* Quiz preview
* Running the user‑created quiz
* Separation between official quizzes and user quizzes

---

#### Architectural impact (current)

* None at runtime
* Only required:

  * defined route
  * existing wireframe
  * placeholder component

---

* **Wireframe:** `WF_CREATE_QUIZ_PLACEHOLDER`

---

## Acceptance Criteria

* Users can start, complete, and retake quizzes without friction.
* Progress persists across sessions.
* UX is clear, consistent, and predictable.
* Architecture supports future expansion without major refactors.
