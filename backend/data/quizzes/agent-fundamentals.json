      "conceptExplanation": "An AI agent is a software entity that acts autonomously to achieve specific goals. It perceives its environment through sensors, processes information using its knowledge base, and takes actions through actuators."

      "explanation": "Sensors allow agents to perceive their environment, while actuators enable them to take actions. These are fundamental components for any agent system.",
      "conceptExplanation": "Agents interact with their environment through two key components: sensors (for perception) and actuators (for action). Sensors gather information about the environment, while actuators allow the agent to execute actions that change the environment."

      "conceptExplanation": "Knowledge-based agents represent information about the world using a knowledge base (KB) and use logical inference to derive new knowledge and make decisions. This approach is more flexible and powerful than simple rule-based systems."
