      "explanation": "Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to get desired outputs from AI models.",
      "conceptExplanation": "Prompt engineering involves crafting clear, specific instructions that help AI models understand exactly what you want. Good prompts include context, examples, and clear formatting instructions."

      "explanation": "Few-shot prompting provides examples of input-output pairs to teach the model the desired format or reasoning pattern.",
      "conceptExplanation": "Few-shot prompting is a technique where you include several examples (shots) of the task in your prompt. This helps the model understand the pattern and produce similar outputs for new inputs."

      "explanation": "Temperature controls the randomness of the model's output. Lower values (0.1) are more deterministic; higher values (0.9) are more creative.",
      "conceptExplanation": "Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the probability distribution over tokens. Lower temperatures make the model more conservative and predictable, while higher temperatures encourage diverse and creative outputs."

      "conceptExplanation": "Chain-of-thought prompting is a technique where you explicitly ask the model to think step by step or show its work. This improves performance on complex reasoning tasks like math problems or logical puzzles."
